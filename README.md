Simple Portfolio SPA

About:
This is my current portfolio, showcasing the work I've completed and what I'm currently creating.

I decided to make this a React application because I wanted more practice at using React, and I believe that the components at the heart of React would be the best way to efficiently code the application. Throughout the application, I have applied my favorite CSS techniques to achieve some fun styles.

The biggest obstacle I faced on this project was correctly dealing with useState. It makes me very happy to say that I was able to correctly implement it and have a deeper understanding of the concept now.

My favorite part of this project is seeing the final product, and enjoying seeing all of my hardwork come to life.

Please feel free to review my code, and reach out if you have any suggestions or if you're interested in working on a project with me.
