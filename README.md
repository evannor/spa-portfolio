Simple Portfolio SPA

About:
This is my current portfolio, showcasing the work I've completed and what I'm currently creating.
I decided to make this a React application because I wanted more practice at using React, and I believe that the components at the heart of React would be the best way to efficiently code the application. Throughout the application, I have applied my favorite coding techniques and utilized code outside of frameworks. Some styling support exists through the use of the Bootstrap framework.
